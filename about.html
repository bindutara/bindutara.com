<p>Bindutara Enterprises is a Kolkata-based transport solution company focused on empowering individuals by enabling car ownership through flexible rent-to-own schemes. 
We aim to support unemployed youth, self-employed drivers, and aspiring fleet operators by providing them access to brand new cars such as WagonR, Swift, Ertiga, and Tigor EVs, without the burden of upfront costs.</p>

<p>Our mission is to revolutionize the commercial vehicle space with eco-conscious choices, including electric vehicle (EV) conversions and sustainable operations. We partner with cab aggregators and offer flexible repayment models. 
We also help our drivers with government-backed financial schemes and vehicle loans through recognized programs such as Startup India and Pragati.</p>

<p>Bindutara stands for transparency, growth, and opportunity. We are not just a business â€” we are a movement toward economic inclusion and mobility independence.</p>
