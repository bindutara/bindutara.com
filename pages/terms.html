    <h1>Refund and Cancellation Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> July 8, 2025</p>

    <h2>1. No Cancellation Post Signup</h2>
    <p>Once the customer has signed the agreement and payment has been made for onboarding, processing, or initial rental, no cancellation will be entertained under any circumstances. This applies regardless of whether the vehicle has been assigned, delivered, or used.</p>

    <h2>2. No Refund After Contract Execution</h2>
    <p>After the rent-to-own contract is signed and activated, all payments made (security deposit, processing fees, daily/monthly rental, etc.) are non-refundable. Customers are expected to complete the full contract term as agreed.</p>

    <h2>3. Refund Eligibility (If Applicable)</h2>
    <p>Refunds will only be considered in rare, valid exceptions including:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Vehicle unavailability from the company’s end before onboarding.</li>
      <li>Duplicate payment errors reported within 24 hours of the transaction.</li>
      <li>Advance payments made by mistake before agreement signing (subject to case review).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Refund Processing Timeline</h2>
    <p>In case of a valid refund eligibility, the refund process may take a minimum of 7 working days and up to 30 working days from the date of confirmation by our customer support team. The refund will be credited to the original payment mode only.</p>

    <h2>5. Contract Completion</h2>
    <p>At the end of the contact term (or full repayment as per agreement), no separate refund is applicable. The customer is entitled to ownership transfer of the vehicle after all dues are cleared, but any rent paid throughout the term remains non-refundable.</p>

    <h2>6. Early Termination or Foreclosure</h2>
    <p>If the customer initiates early contract termination or foreclosure, all payments made till date (rent, deposit, processing, interest) shall be treated as consumed. No refund shall be processed. Foreclosure must be done as per clause mentioned in your agreement, with all outstanding dues settled.</p>

    <h2>7. Security Deposit Adjustments</h2>
    <p>If a security deposit is collected and contract is completed successfully, the deposit may be adjusted toward name transfer or final dues. If the vehicle is returned with damage or dues pending, deductions will apply. No interest is paid on deposits.</p>

    <h2>8. Dispute and Final Authority</h2>
    <p>Any refund or exception is subject to management’s internal review and discretion. Bindutara Enterprises reserves the right to decline refund requests if found inconsistent with policy terms. All disputes shall be resolved under Kolkata jurisdiction.</p>
